# `ctvh` -- The CRAN Task View Handbook (creator)

This repository contains a small set of routines dealing with creation of a hanbook with actual description of packages dependent on the specific topic.

### Key tools:

* `Bash`: to generate sets of routines
* `Pandoc` (https://pandoc.org/): to be able to convert multiple html's to a single epub or fb2
* `GNU wget` (https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/): to produce accurate and wise download of the web-pages
